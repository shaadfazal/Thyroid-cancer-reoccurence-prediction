# 🧠 Thyroid Disease Classification Project

## 📘 Overview

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to classify thyroid disease using patient data. The model is built using the **Random Forest Classifier** from scikit-learn and is designed to predict whether a patient is affected by a thyroid condition based on various medical indicators.

## 📂 Dataset

The project uses a dataset named `dataset.csv`. It contains patient-level features such as hormone levels, diagnostic indicators, and other relevant medical data.

> **Note**: Ensure the dataset is in the same directory as the notebook for the code to run properly.

## 🚀 Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
2. **Label Encoding of Categorical Features**
3. **Train/Test Split**
4. **Model Training using Random Forest Classifier**
5. **Model Evaluation** using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report
